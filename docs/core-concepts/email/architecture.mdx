## Overview

InsForge provides a managed email service for sending transactional emails. Built on AWS SES, it offers high deliverability and scalability without requiring you to configure email infrastructure.

## How It Works

1. **SDK Call** - Your application calls `emails.send()` with recipients and HTML content
2. **API Processing** - Request is validated and authenticated
3. **Cloud Delivery** - InsForge Cloud queues and sends via AWS SES
4. **Delivery** - Email is delivered to recipient inboxes

```mermaid

    participant App as Your App
    participant SDK as InsForge SDK
    participant API as Email API
    participant SES as AWS SES

    App->>SDK: emails.send({to, subject, html})
    SDK->>API: POST /api/email/send-raw
    API->>SES: Queue for delivery
    SES-->>API: Accepted
    API-->>SDK: Success
    SDK-->>App: {data, error}
```
