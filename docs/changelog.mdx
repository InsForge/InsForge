    ### OAuth: 4 New Third-Party Providers
    You can now enable third-party logins with **LinkedIn, Microsoft, Facebook, and Discord**. On InsForge Cloud, we provide shared credentials for developers who want to quickly test these login flows.

    After enabling, you can implement these logins directly through your agent by sending a simple prompt:

    ```text
    implement Discord login
    ```

    ### Import CSV to Your Table
    You can now upload `.csv` files directly into any table from the dashboard. Perfect for bringing in sample data or migrating from other tools.

    ### InsForge.js SDK
    We've released our **insforge-js SDK** to make it easier for developers to integrate InsForge into their workflows. Manage auth, query databases, and control your backend programmatically with a few lines of code.

    **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/InsForge/InsForge-sdk-js)

    ### Logs
    The new logs page lets you monitor container logs in real time. You can watch your backend activity directly in the dashboard, or let AI coding agents query logs through the InsForge MCP to automatically debug and search for errors.
