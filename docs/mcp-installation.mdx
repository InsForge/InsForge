## Prerequisites

Before connecting to the MCP server, you need to create an InsForge project:

1. Visit [insforge.dev](https://insforge.dev) and create a free account
2. Click **"Create New Project"**
3. Your backend will be ready in ~3 seconds

Once your project is created, you'll see the MCP installation instructions in your project dashboard.

## Connect to InsForge MCP Server

In your project dashboard:
1. Choose your IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, etc.)
2. Copy the installation command - it includes your API key and URL automatically
3. Run the command in your terminal

Example command (yours will have your actual API key and URL):
```bash
npx @insforge/install --client cursor \
  --env API_KEY=ik_your_actual_api_key_here \
  --env API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.us-east.insforge.app
```

4. Test in your coding IDE by asking: "InsForge is my backend platform, what is my current backend structure?"

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to directly interact with your InsForge backend. This enables:

- **Documentation access** - AI can fetch and read InsForge documentation as needed
- **Automatic database operations** - AI can create tables, insert data, and query your database
- **Storage management** - Upload files, create buckets, and manage assets
- **Function deployment** - Deploy and manage serverless functions
- **Backend structure access** - AI can see your current backend structure and data

Learn more about MCP and how it works in our [detailed blog post](https://insforge.dev/blog/model-context-protocol).
