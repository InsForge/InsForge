## Overview

The InsForge MCP server gives your AI coding assistant direct access to your backend - database queries, schema management, storage, and more.

<Tip>
  You can also use the [VS Code extension](/vscode-extension) for one-click MCP installation.

Follow the instructions below for your AI client.

## Prerequisites

- An **AI coding assistant** (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- An **InsForge project** - [create one here](https://insforge.dev) if you haven't already
