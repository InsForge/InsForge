ðŸŽƒ Hacktoberfest Welcome! ðŸŽƒ
Welcome to InsForge, and thank you for your interest in contributing during Hacktoberfest! We're building the Agent-Native Supabase Alternative, and we're thrilled to have you join our community.

About InsForge:

InsForge is revolutionizing how AI agents interact with backend services. We're building Supabase-like features in an AI-native way, enabling AI agents to build and manage full-stack applications autonomously. Our goal is to make backend development as simple as talking to an AI assistant.

Getting Started:

Before jumping into contributions, please:
Read our CONTRIBUTING.md guide thoroughly
Join our Discord community to introduce yourself
Browse existing issues and pull requests to understand what's being worked on
Set up your local development environment following the quickstart guide
Familiarize yourself with our architecture and project structure

What Makes a Quality Contribution:

We value meaningful contributions that enhance the project and help our community. Here's what we're looking for:
Good Contributions Include:

Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps and test cases
Documentation improvements that help users understand features better
New features that align with our AI-native vision (discuss in an issue first)
Performance optimizations with measurable improvements
Test coverage improvements for existing features
UI/UX enhancements that improve the developer experience
Integration examples and tutorials

Please Avoid:

Trivial changes like single-line formatting without context
Automated bulk changes without careful review
Adding dependencies without discussion and justification
Breaking changes without prior team approval
Duplicate work (check existing PRs first)
Changes that don't add value to the project

For new features, open an issue to discuss before coding
Fork the repository and create a feature branch from main
Ensure Docker and Node.js are properly installed

While Working:

Follow our branch naming convention: type/description
Write clear, descriptive commit messages using Conventional Commits format
Keep commits focused and atomic
Add or update tests for your changes
Update documentation to reflect your changes
Run linters and tests before pushing

Code Quality Standards:

Follow TypeScript best practices and use proper typing
Write unit tests for new features
Run npm run lint before committing
Run npm test:e2e to verify everything works
Keep functions small and focused
Use meaningful variable and function names
Add comments for complex logic

Hacktoberfest-Specific Guidelines:
Remember that Hacktoberfest is about learning and making meaningful contributions. Here's what we value:

Quality over quantity: One well-tested feature is better than multiple rushed changes
Learning opportunity: Use this as a chance to learn about AI-native development
Community engagement: Join discussions, help others, and share knowledge
Long-term value: Contribute changes that will benefit users for months to come
