Choose an AI framework or service that fits your needs, such as OpenAI or Anthropic Claude. Design conversational flows that guide users through interactions naturally. Implement natural language processing to understand user intents and respond appropriately. Set up a backend to handle API calls and manage conversation context. Test extensively with real users to refine responses and improve accuracy.`,
